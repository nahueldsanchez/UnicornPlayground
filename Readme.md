## Installing unicorn engine (CPU emulator framework) on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

Steps based on [1](#References)

1) Install **libglib2.0-dev** package by running:  `sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev`
2) Clone **Unicorn-Engline's repository:** `git clone https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn.git`
3) Open the unicorn directory: `cd unicorn`
4) Run `./make.sh`
5) Export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH: </path_where_libunicorn.so.1_is_stored>
6) Excute `./samples/sample_all.sh` _#Samples should run without problems_

At this point we've installed **unicorn engine's core**. Let's install **the Python binding**:

7) Create `virtualenv` and **activate** it
8) Run `cd bindings/python`
9) Run `make`
10) Run `python setup.py install`
11) Excute `./sample_x86.py` _#Samples should run without problems_


Now we've everything installed.

## Installing **keystone engine** (The Ultimate Assembler Framework) on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

As a prerequisite **cmake** must be installed in the target system.

1) Clone **keystone-engine** repository: `git clone https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone.git`
2) Open the keystone directory by running: `cd keystone/`
3) Create a new directory: `mkdir build`
4) Open the directory: `cd build/`
5) Excute `../make-share.sh`
6) Run export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_keystone>/build/llvm/lib/
7) Test if the installation was successful. 
8) Go to kstoolL `cd kstool`
9) ./kstool x32 "add eax, ebx", should return add eax, ebx = [ 01 d8 ]

Now, we'll install the **Python bindings**:

10) create a `virtualenv` and **activate** it (Or better, use the previously created virtualenv)
11) Run: `pip install keystone-engine`
12) To test it, run `python` and try to import keystone: `from keystone import *`


## Installing **Capstone engine** (The Ultimate Disassembler) on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

1) Clone **Capstone.Capstone** repository: `git clone https://github.com/aquynh/capstone.git`
2) Open the directory: `cd capstone`
3) Run: `./make.sh`
4) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:</path_where_libcapstone.so.4_is_stored>
5) We've installed **Capstone** successfully. Let's test it.
6) Go to the Capstone installation directory `./test subdirectory.`
7) Execute some tests; everything should run flawlessly.

Now, we'll install the **Python binding**:

8) Create a `virtualenv` and **activate** it (Or better, use the previously created virtualenv)
9) Run `pip install capstone`
10) To test it, run `python` and execute: `from capstone import *`

## Setting up the virtualenv

I've added the following lines to the **"activate"** file to avoid executing them every time I have to use the tools:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:</path_where_libcapstone.so.4_is_stored>

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_keystone>/build/llvm/lib/

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:</path_where_libunicorn.so.1_is_stored>
```

## Solving the challenges

Once we've everything installed we'll be able to "run" the provided assembly code and luckily answer the following question: **What's stored in EAX at the end of the execution?**

To answer that —and justify installing all the tools too :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: — I've created two `Python` scripts that perform two tasks:

1) Take **assembly code** and translate it to **machine code**.
2) Take the previously obtained machine code and emulates it using **Unicorn Engine**

Once the emulation is completed the scripts print the value of the **EAX register**.

You can find two folders:
+  `picoCTF2018_assembly-0` and  
+ `picoCTF2018_assembly-1`  

which contain the Python scripts to solve both challenges. I've added some hooks
to understand how to use this functionality as it may be useful for other tasks.

I've also had to modify the provided assembly a little bit to be able to emulate it.

I've performed the following changes:   
:ballot_box_with_check: added some push instructions at the beginning to pass the arguments to the functions  
:ballot_box_with_check: added some fake return address (push 0x00) to align the stack  
:ballot_box_with_check: removed the ret instruction in assembly-1 as the emulation tried to continue once all the provided code was already executed.
